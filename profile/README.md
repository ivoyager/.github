I, Voyager is a free, open-source software planetarium and development platform for creating games and educational apps in a realistic solar system.

It is designed to be improved, modified and extended by the community. I, Voyager runs on the open-source [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) and primarily uses Godotâ€™s easy-to-learn [GDScript](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#doc-gdscript) (similar to Python). It can be extended using GDScript, C# or C++. Our web-based Planetarium app can be accessed [here](https://www.ivoyager.dev/planetarium/).
